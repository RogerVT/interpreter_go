# interpreter_go
Interpreter for a mockup language written in Go. This project was done in accordance to Thorsten Ball's [Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). 
While the interpreter described through the book is built for a language called 'Monkey' this interpreter may be used for a different langauge.
